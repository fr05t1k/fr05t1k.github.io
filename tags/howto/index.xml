      <title>How to optimize aggregate queries in Clickhouse?</title>

      <description>Overview Clickhouse is quite fast storage, but when your storage is huge enough searching and aggregating in raw data become quite expensive. In this case you would think about optimization some queries. Today I would like to talk about a way where we will use AggregatingMergeTree with Materialized View. Materialized View gets all data by a given query and AggregatingMergeTree aggregates inserted records by sorting key. With this approach, We can group data by some fields and it helps us optimize heavy queries for a long period.</description>

      <title>How To Trace Your System Calls On Mac OS</title>

      <description>DTruss DTruss is analog of strace in linux and uses DTrase for it. It allows you to trace system calls from a running process or run a process with tracing.
Note But from past versions of Mac OS, some paths are protected by SIP(System Integrity Protection) (i.e. /usr/bin) and cannot be traced. But there is a workaround, to change settings in recovery mode but I would not recommend it to you.</description>
